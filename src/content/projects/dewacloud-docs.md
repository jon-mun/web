### Overview

An official documentation site for the Dewacloud platform, serving as a centralized knowledge base for internal and external users. The platform improves developer onboarding, reduces support overhead, and streamlines how documentation evolves with the product.

### What I Did

- Led a team of developers throughout the project lifecycle.
- Designed the architecture, documentation structure, and contribution workflow.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines, automated builds, and hosted the platform on Dewacloud.
- Integrated Typesense DocSearch for fast, scalable search.
- Built internal tooling to standardize content updates and ensure reliability.

### Challenges

- Coordinating different contributors with varying technical backgrounds.
- Ensuring documentation stays synchronized with rapidly evolving features.
- Improving search performance while keeping hosting costs low.
