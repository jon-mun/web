### Overview

A full food-ordering and delivery system similar to GoFood, built as a major software engineering project. Includes customer, merchant, and driver applications.

### What I Did

- Designed the entire system architecture and database.
- Implemented the backend API with Express and custom JWT authentication.
- Developed features across multiple mobile apps (customer, merchant, driver).
- Integrated routing and distance calculations using Openrouteservice.
- Coordinated development across a team of six.

### Challenges

- Building three separate apps plus backend under academic deadlines.
- Team members had limited development experience, requiring extra technical support.
